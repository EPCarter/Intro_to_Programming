Summary: (Guess the capitals) Write a program that repeatedly 
          prompts the user to enter a capital for a state. Upon
          receiving the user input, the program reports whether 
          the answer is correct. Assume that 10 states and their 
          capitals are stored in a two-dimensional array, as shown 
          in Figure 8.10. The program prompts the user to answer 
          states’ capitals and displays the total correct count. 
          The user’s answer is not case-sensitive.

          This assignment has been edited from the book version to 
          use an array that stores only 10 states and capitals.

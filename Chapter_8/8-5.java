Summary: (Algebra: add two matrices) Write a method to add two matrices. 
          The header of the method is as follows:
          
              public static double[][] addMatrix(double[][] a, double[][] b)
          
          In order to be added, the two matrices must have the same dimensions
          and the same or compatible types of elements. Let c be the resulting 
          matrix. Each element c[i][j] is a[i][j]+b[i][j].
          
              Example:

                  1.0   2.0   3.0   0.0  2.0  4.0   1.0  4.0  7.0
                  4.0   5.0   6.0 + 1.0  4.5  2.2 = 5.0  9.5  8.2
                  7.0   8.0   9.0   1.1  4.3  5.2   8.1  12.3  14.2

## Repository Overview

This is a repository of Java programs curated to showcase various key Java principles touched on in *Introduction to Java Programming: Comprehensive Version, 10th Ed by Y. Daniel Liang*

## Final Project Synopsis

This program takes in a database of addresses and a user input and returns all of the criteria that matches.

## Code Example
   Database.csv is input

   User search criteria input

   Input cleaned up and stored

   Matching input listings printed

   User choice input

   Missing information for choice queried from Google Maps API

   Returned data (such as latitude and longitude) printed

   Distance between two coordinates returned

## Motivation

This program fills a niche left by other programs in allowing a query about points near a given location. It allows users to be given information about entries in a job database quickly and without other employees necessary.

Summary: (Algebra: solve 2 * 2 linear equations) You can use Cramerâ€™s rule 
          to solve the following 2 * 2 system of linear equation:
            ax + by = e
            x = (ed - bf) / (ad - bc)
            cx + dy - f
            y = (af - ec) / (ad - bc)
          
          Write a program that solves the following equation and displays the value for x and y:
            3.4x + 50.2y = 44.5
            2.1x + 0.55y = 5.9

          (Hint: Use the equations given first to identify what numeric value replaces which number. In this case, a is 3.4.)

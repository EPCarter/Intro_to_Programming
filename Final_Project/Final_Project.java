Summary: Think of a project that uses multiple items you have learned

              1. Introduction: Overview of your project (1 paragraph)
              2. Target Population: Who are you directing this software and

              3. Purpose to the consumer: what makes your program unique, 
                  what makes it a better option than other software or is 
                  there a lack of software in this field? Is it helpful, how so? 
                  (3 paragraphs)

           GitHub is a great way to market your product and show off your code.  
           The formatting and information of your README page is especially helpful 
           to give your target audience the best impression of your code.  Here is
           a template (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site. for a 
           GitHub README page along with general guidelines (Links to an external 
           site.)Links to an external site. to follow and reasons (Links to an external 
           site.)Links to an external site.why someone wouldn't use your code.  Read 
           through these and use Mr. Perkins's Angular.io repository to help shape 
           your own README page.
           
           Please add all files needed to run your code, a JavaDoc for your code, 
           and a README for your project using the examples above onto your GitHub 
           and submit the link here.

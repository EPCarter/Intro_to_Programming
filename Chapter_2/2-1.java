Summary: (Convert Celsius to Fahrenheit) Write a program that reads a Celsius degree 
          in a double value from the console, then converts it to Fahrenheit and displays 
          the result. The formula for the conversion is as follows: 
          
            fahrenheit = (9 / 5) * celsius + 32

        (Hint: In Java, 9 / 5 is 1, but 9.0 / 5 is 1.8.)

Summary: (Print distinct numbers) Write a program that reads in ten 
          numbers and displays the number of distinct numbers and 
          the distinct numbers separated by exactly one space 
          (i.e., if a number appears multiple times, it is displayed only once).

          (Hint: Read a number and store it to an array if it is new. 
          If the number is already in the array, ignore it.)

          After the input, the array contains the distinct numbers.

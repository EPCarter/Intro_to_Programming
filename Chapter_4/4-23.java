Summary: (Financial application: payroll) Write a program 
          that reads the following information and prints 
          a payroll statement:

             Employeeâ€™s name (e.g., Smith)
             Number of hours worked in a week (e.g., 10)
             Hourly pay rate (e.g., 9.75)
             Federal tax withholding rate (e.g., 20%)
             State tax withholding rate (e.g., 9%)

        Remember to not use nextLine() after nextInt() for reasons 
        explained on page 480. This will case a logic error when 
        running the program.

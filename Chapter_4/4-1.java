Summary: (Geometry: area of a pentagon) Write a program that 
          prompts the user to enter the length from the center 
          of a pentagon to a vertex and computes the area of 
          the pentagon, as shown in the following figure.
          
          The formula for computing the area of a pentagon is:
          
              Area = (5 * s^2) / [4 * tan(pi/5)]
            
           where s is the length of a side. The side can be 
           computed using the formula:
           
              s = 2r sin 5
              
            where r is the length from the center of a pentagon 
            to a vertex. Round up two digits after the decimal point.

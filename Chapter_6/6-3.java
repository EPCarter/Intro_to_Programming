Summary: (Palindrome integer) Write the methods with the following headers:
            
              // Return the reversal of an integer, i.e., reverse(456) returns 654
              public static int reverse(int number) 
              // Return true if number is a palindrome
              public static boolean isPalindrome(int number)

          Use the reverse method to implement isPalindrome. A number is a palindrome 
          if its reversal is the same as itself. Write a test program that prompts the 
          user to enter an integer and reports whether the integer is a palindrome.

          (Hint: The isPalindrome method should call the reverse method.)

Summary: (Algebra: solve 2 * 2 linear equations) A linear equation can 
          be solved using Cramer’s rule given in Programming Exercise 1.13
          (shown below). Write a program that prompts the user to enter 
          a, b, c, d, e, and f and displays the result. If ad - bc is 0, 
          report that “The equation has no solution.”

              ax + by = e
              cx + dy = f
              x = (ed - bf) / (ad - bc)
              y = (af - ec) / (ad - bc)
          
          (Hint: Only solve the equations below if ad - bc is not 0.)

Summary: (Count vowels and consonants) Assume letters 
          A, E, I, O, and U as the vowels. Write a 
          program that prompts the user to enter a 
          string and displays the number of vowels 
          and consonants in the string.

          Hint: Use the method "toUpperCase()" on your 
          character to simplify the conditions of your 
          if statement
